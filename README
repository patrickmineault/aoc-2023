# AOC 2023

I first intended to do advent of code in Mojo, but quickly ran into the issue that Mojo has very little in terms of string handling and variadic lists, and a lot of AOC is about that. I didn't want to just write a bunch of Python in Mojo, so I decided to switch things up for day 2 and do it in Julia. I might try different languages.

I've been assisted by ChatGPT (GPT-4) for general guides, hints for improvements, etc., but I've tried to write most of the code myself.
